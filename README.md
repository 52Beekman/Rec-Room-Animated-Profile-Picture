# Rec-Room-Animated-Profile-Picture
Allows profile pictures to be automatically updated

To get this working you will need: your User Cookie, the python Requests library, the image names of the pictures you want to add, a basic understanding of python.

I will make videos on how to get this working but im currently just putting something out their because people have been asking how it works, when I get those videos published I will have a link below here

What is a User Cookie and how to get it: Not Available

Detailed code explanation: Not Available

Also please give me a break for anything that doesnt make sense code wise, I wrote this script when I was bored in home room (although i will be updating it, just give me time).

If you have any errors with the program feel free to make a issue report and I will try to respond as quickly as possible

ALSO if I am putting ALL of my base tools for api requests etc into a new repo called Rec-Room-API-Tool-Box (https://github.com/zigzatuzoo/Rec-Room-API-Tool-Box), if you make something cool that you want more people to mess around with, just message me and ill add you as a contributor.
